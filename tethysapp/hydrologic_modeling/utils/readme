#Please import the tool AutoPTPK_2 into the ArcGIS
#The scripts here are to be run from inside of ArcGIS environment, except SSURGO_merge_tool2.py
#All of them, except SSURGO_merge_tool2.py uses arcpy module
#Also, some of them use Pandas and few other modules
#Files have different names in ArcGIS tool, 

[files]
GetDataPTPK_Tool		Downloads DEM and Landuse data from the we, using arcgis services
[STEP1..]				{
						Associated with get data script in ArcGIS
						Inputs: a polygen shapefile(located in a geodatabase), a geodatabase to save
						Output: DEM and the landuse data, (downloaded)}
DEM_processing_Tool		Preprocessing of DEM and Landuse data to create useful datasets
[STEP2..]				{
						Inputs: DEM, Landuse,draining outlet point shapefile, Personal Geodatabase
						Output: files in the Geodatabase, projected in UTM  Zone 12
								str_cr   (stream network)
								fdr_cr   (flow direction)
								mask_r    (watershed area)
								SD        (soil depth raster) 
								n_channel,(Mannings coefficient for Channel) 
								n_Overland (Mannings coefficient for overland)
								drp_r     (slope or drop)
								DEM_Prj_C} (DEM file)	
								}
SSURGO_merge_tool2		Joins different SSURGO tables, maps all soil properties required to map units
[STEP3..]				To be run  from an environment that contains Pandas module
						{
						Inputs: A folder that contains the SSURGO folders (SSURGO downloaded data come in folders like UT_612)
							    Path to the GreenAmpt lookup tables, that matches soil to different properties	 
						Output: In each SSURGO folder, MUKEY-Vs-Values.csv is created 
						}
								
Join and Feature to Raster
[STEP4..]				Joins the soil properties files that were mapped to map units to the SSURGO shapefile
						{
						Inputs: The folder that contains the SSURGO folders (SSURGO downloaded data come in folders like UT_612)
								A raster to match the extent and projection, recommended:DEM_Prj_C
								A folder where the rasters created are to be saved
						Output: Projected SSURGO shapefile, with soil properties column joint
								Rasters:
								KSAT-t_UTxxxc (saturated Hydraulic Conductivity)
								EFPO-t_UTxxxc (Effective porosity)
								RSM-t_UTxxxc  (Residual Soil Moisture Content)
								BBL-t_UTxxxc  (Bubbling Pressure)
								PSD-t_UTxxxc  (Pore size distribution)
						}
						
*NOTE: All the files as output (from "Join and Feature to Raster", and "DEM_processing_Tool" ) needs to be converted to tifs using arcGIS tool "to the other format"
**Other files can be ignored for now
